--- NOTES ---

Layers in 2D, for 3D top-down sensibility:
We split sprites into layers...

1. Ground
2. Walk in front of objs
3. Collision (on same plane)

3.5 PLAYER

4. Walk behind objs
5. Decoration




--- STEPS/PROJECT COMPONENTS --- 
Documenting the major components and steps taken for this project.

1. Setting up and animating player character: 
    - Used a sprite sheet containing anims for up,down,left,right, idle and walking.
Sliced these sheets to fit character size and assigned the sprites to playerInput system.
    - Used playerMovement script function to assign variables for input system movement, 
 used blend 2D nodes in animator to transition between states.


2. Player camera setup:
    - Cinemachine is a package, this hijacks the main camera and makes camera setup incredibly easy. 
This makes it all UI/component changes rather than code. Set it to 'follow' the player.
    - Applied a polygonal bounding box to a cinemachine 'confiner' component which has all 
the stopping and damping options you'd want...

3. Assigned a tilemap, tilepalette, and tilesets:
    - This system in Unity is very powerful. Created a layer for ground, walk-in-front, player, walk-behind, etc.
This means creating a tilepalette for some set of tiles, then creating a layer and painting those in the scene.
    - Once assigned, multiple layers can be drawn and deleted individually. This makes change/iteration very fast 
(if assigned correctly)
    - Create a tile-atlas to compress tilesets, this significantly reduces draw calls and improves performance... 
This may reduce screen tearing too.


##### TO RESEARCH
Rule Tiling -> A system so that you do not need to place all tiles yourself, 
it draws in the correct/preset tiles when painting.
