--- NOTES ---

Layers in 2D, for 3D top-down sensibility:
We split sprites into layers...

1. Ground
2. Walk in front of objs
3. Collision (on same plane)

3.5 PLAYER

4. Walk behind objs
5. Decoration




--- STEPS/PROJECT COMPONENTS --- 
Documenting the major components and steps taken for this project.

1. Setting up and animating player character: 
    - Used a sprite sheet containing anims for up,down,left,right, idle and walking.
Sliced these sheets to fit character size and assigned the sprites to playerInput system.
    - Used playerMovement script function to assign variables for input system movement, 
 used blend 2D nodes in animator to transition between states.


2. Player camera setup:
    - Cinemachine is a package, this hijacks the main camera and makes camera setup incredibly easy. 
This makes it all UI/component changes rather than code. Set it to 'follow' the player.
    - Applied a polygonal bounding box to a cinemachine 'confiner' component which has all 
the stopping and damping options you'd want...

3. Assigned a tilemap, tilepalette, and tilesets:
    - This system in Unity is very powerful. Created a layer for ground, walk-in-front, player, walk-behind, etc.
This means creating a tilepalette for some set of tiles, then creating a layer and painting those in the scene.
    - Once assigned, multiple layers can be drawn and deleted individually. This makes change/iteration very fast 
(if assigned correctly)
    - Create a tile-atlas to compress tilesets, this significantly reduces draw calls and improves performance... 
This may reduce screen tearing too.

4. UI system:
    - I am using Unity's Canvas system, which is robust and allows for creating grids for UI elements.
The menu constructed is 4 tabs with associated pages. The tabs use an image (just an imported sprite) with a 
textmeshpro object inside of it.
    - A script attached to the tab parent object cycles through the tabs to set one active and the others inactive.
These tabs have an event trigger component which listens for PointerDown, and when heard, activates the given tab and its 
associated page.


##### TO RESEARCH
Rule Tiling -> A system so that you do not need to place all tiles yourself, 
it draws in the correct/preset tiles when painting.

Shaders... It would be good to know some basic shader maths and algorithms.
Where do people find custom shaders, how are they implemented in Unity...
